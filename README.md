# Spam-Detection
Here in this project we can analysis or predict if the provided Text Is Spam or Ham by using some data. I made this project using Machine learning and Python. This model has 98+% accuracy. This project is easy to compile just you need to install some required python libraries  and run it in your respective notebook.

Also I have used PySimpleGUI to create an simple UI for the project.
